This code is work in progress! It is not finnished yet, feel free co contribute to it.

Example Code how to use the fsapi (Frontier Silicon API for PHP):

As an example I created an radio-gui (website) with xajax, jquery and bootstrap.

You can use composer to install all necessary dependencies:

```bash
unzip master.zip
